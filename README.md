## About The Project

[![EOG App][demo-gif]](https://github.com/ronaldosena/eogapp)

This was a college project that captures eye movements and displayed them on the screen. The goal was to control a mouse pointer just with your eye movement. In this repo, you will find both the firmware and the desktop app that I used. As for the electronic circuit, it was a standard instrumentation amplifier tunned for electrical signals from eye muscles.
